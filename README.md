# aMazing - Algorithmic Maze Generation & Solution Visualization #

This advanced Python application uses recursive backtracking to generate random mazes and depth-first searching to solve them. Features real-time Tkinter visualization and step-by-step algorithm animation.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Recursive Maze Generation**: Implements the recursive backtracking algorithm for maze creation
- **Intelligent Pathfinding**: Depth-first search algorithm with visual path tracking
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Tkinter-based GUI with smooth animation and color-coded paths
- **Algorithm Animation**: Step-by-step visualization of both generation and solving processes
- **Interactive Graphics**: Custom graphics engine with coordinate system management
  
## üéØ Skills Demonstrated

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Classic CS algorithms (backtracking, DFS) with proper recursion
- **Data Structures**: 2D arrays, grid navigation, and state management
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean class hierarchies and encapsulation
- **GUI Programming**: Event-driven interfaces with real-time updates
- **Recursive Programming**: Deep understanding of recursive problem-solving patterns
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage for algorithm correctness
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Coordinate systems and geometric calculations

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Algorithmic Design
- **Recursive Backtracking**: Generates mazes by carving paths through a grid of walls
- **Depth-First Search**: Solves mazes using recursive exploration with backtracking
- **Grid-Based Representation**: 2D matrix of cell objects with wall state management
- **State Management**: Tracks visited cells and wall configurations throughout algorithms

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Cell-Based Architecture**: Each maze cell encapsulates wall states and drawing logic
- **Graphics Abstraction**: Window, Point, and Line classes for rendering management
- **Modular Components**: Separate concerns for maze logic, graphics, and algorithm execution


### Graphics System
- **Custom Tkinter Wrapper**: Object-oriented graphics abstraction layer
- **Coordinate System**: Point and line rendering with proper scaling
- **Animation Framework**: Timed rendering updates with configurable delays
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded paths (red for solution, grey for backtracking)


## üíª Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python with object-oriented programming
- **Tkinter**: Native GUI framework for cross-platform visualization


## üîß Technical Highlights

### Recursive Backtracking Algorithm
```python
def _break_walls_r(self, i, j):
    """Generate maze using recursive backtracking"""
    current_cell = self._cells[i][j]
    current_cell.visited = True
    
    while True:
        neighbors = self._get_unvisited_neighbors(i, j)
        if not neighbors:
            self._draw_cell(i, j)
            return
            
        # Choose random neighbor and break walls
        direction = random.choice(neighbors)
        self._break_wall(i, j, direction)
        self._break_walls_r(next_i, next_j)
```

### Depth-First Search Solver
```python
def _solve_r(self, i, j):
    """Solve maze using recursive DFS with visualization"""
    current_cell = self._cells[i][j]
    current_cell.visited = True
    
    if i == self._num_cols - 1 and j == self._num_rows - 1:
        return True  # Reached exit
        
    # Try each possible direction
    for direction in self._get_valid_moves(i, j):
        self._draw_move(current_cell, next_cell)
        if self._solve_r(next_i, next_j):
            return True
        # Backtrack visualization
        self._draw_move(current_cell, next_cell, undo=True)
```
